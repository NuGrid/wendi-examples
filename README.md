# The Web Exploration of NuGrid Datasets: Interactive (WENDI)

The interface provides a variety of NuGrid data access, processing and analysis tools via Jupyter notebooks.

## Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis data

NuGrid provides stellar evolution and post-processing nucleosynthesis data for exploration in the ```StellarDataSets``` directory.
A interface to explore data is in ```Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis data/Star_explore.ipynb```.
Analysis examples can be found in ```Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis data/Examples```.

## SYGMA

Capabilities for the Stellar Yields for Galactic Modeling Applications (SYGMA) module are in teh ```SYGMA``` directory.
The SYGMA web interface can be found in ```SYGMA/SYGMA self-guided user interface.ipynb```.
The interface allows to calculate the ejecta and stellar feedback of simple stellar populations as a function of time.
Figures of the SYGMA paper can be found in ```SYGMA/SYGMA_paper ```.
